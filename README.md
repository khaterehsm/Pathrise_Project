# conclusion
Students and the unemployed constitute the most significant group joining the Pathrise program, they are the best target for Pathrise to focus on.

The software engineering field seems to offer the most opportunities in the job market, so fellows with such skills have a better chance of being placed in a job. 

Native Americans seem to face fewer challenges in finding jobs, so Pathrise may not be a popular platform for them. Pathrise needs to concentrate on various groups, especially East Asian and Asian American individuals, to assist them in finding job placements.

Most clients cited hearing back from my application as their major challenge. Therefore, for Pathrise, it is crucial to assist fellows in improving their resumes for their desired jobs.

Work authorization status is a critical factor, and fellows without authorization to work in the US have no chance of finding a job. Finding a job is relatively similar for those authorized to work in the U.S., but it may be slightly more challenging for those on OPT STEM visas.

While finding jobs may be easier for men than women, to avoid discrimination, both groups should be targeted. It is preferable for fellows to disclose their gender.
